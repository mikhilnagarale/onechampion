--One Championship conducts events in a stadium, each event many people visit it and the stats are saved as these columns: id, event_name, people_count

--Take leverage in adding sample data yourself.
--Please write a query to display the records which have 3 or more consecutive events and the amount of people more than 100(inclusive).

----------------------
--Base table schema-
---------------------
create table stats
(id int,
 event_name varchar(100),
 people_count int
);
----------------------
--sample data-
----------------------
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(1 , 'football'  , 50);
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(2 , 'football'  , 60);
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(3 , 'football'  , 70);
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(3 , 'football'  , 80);
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(4 , 'basketball' , 98);
insert into stats(id,event_name,people_count) values(5 , 'basketball'  , 120);
----------------------
--Solution-
----------------------
with a AS 
(select id,event_name,people_count,lag(event_name,1) over(order by id asc) as previous_event from stats),
b AS 
(select id,event_name,people_count,case when a.previous_event=event_name then 1 else 0 end as previous_event_flag),
c AS 
(select id,event_name,people_count,count(previous_event_flag) over(order by id and range between 1 and 1) as consicative_event_count from b),
d AS
(select id,event_name,people_count,lead(consicative_event_count,1) over(order by id) as next_matching_event_rows from c),
e AS
(select id,event_name,next_matching_event_rows,sum(people_count) over(order by id rows between current_row and next_matching_event_rows following) count_of_ppl_next_con_event from d)
select id,event_name
from e where next_matching_event_rows>=2 and count_of_ppl_next_con_event>=100;
